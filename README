Sinko -- Syncing javascript to stuff

Concept: Create an object in JS, apply 'sinko' to it. Tell sinko how to populate the object's properties (it could be from markup, from a function, etc) then work as normal with the object. Once you've made changes to the object, everything that needs to be updated is updated (again, markup could be changed to reflect the objects new state, or a function could be called).

Still very very early days, but has a (growing) test suite! 

MAIN PROBLEM SO FAR:
My JS knowledge is still far from ideal and I'm struggling to figure out how i can make 'sinko' (the function thats transplanted onto the host object) an instance rather than a static. See the failing test in test/index.html
